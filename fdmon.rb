# Consider this application a "top" for watching file descriptors for
# an indicated process ID.  This is handy sometimes if a program
# doesn't tell you what it's doing with its descriptors.  For example,
# I had a program that would not tell me the current status of an
# upload.  By watching as the I/O FDs approached 100%, I could monitor
# its progress.
#
# All of the data comes from /proc.  The user running the program
# needs to have the right permissions to read information for the
# target PIDs /proc content.
